- As a marketing research team member, I want to give focus group participants 25 sets of three random products.

    * I want participants to have to choose one item out of each set of 3 that is their favorite (what they are most likely to buy).

    * I want to count the number of times each product is chosen.

    * I want to be able to visualize the clicks per product as a bar graph.

    * I want the counts per product to stack/accumulate with each 25 guesses, rather than reset each time the page reloads.

- As a developer, I want the participant to click on the product image of their favorite product from the set.

    * I want the research study to stop after 25 sets/choices.

    * I want to create some way to store each products accumulated clicks along with other info relevant to each product.

    * I don't want the same product to show up twice in the same set, or in adjacent sets.

    * I want to count the number of times a product shows up to be able to calculate a ratio of the number times clicked / number of times shown.

    * I want each set to be composed of three images chosen randomly.

- As a focus group participant, I want the page's layout to make interacting with the page intuitive.

    * I want the page to have a pleasant color scheme.

    * I want a short set of instructions describing what I should do.
